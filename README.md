# Project Overview

Retail businesses face constant challenges in managing inventory, forecasting demand, and making data driven decisions. Without the right tools, they rely on intuition, leading to stockouts, overstock, lost revenue, and tied up capital.

RetailIQ solves this by providing a complete AI powered retail intelligence platform that ingests raw sales data and runs it through a full pipeline: data validation, automated feature engineering, multi model demand forecasting with 5 competing ML models, inventory optimization including safety stock, EOQ, reorder points, and stockout prediction, SHAP based explainability, and automated natural language business insights.

The platform is **Pakistan context aware**: it understands local seasons including Spring, Summer, Monsoon, Autumn, and Winter, Islamic holidays including Eid, Ramadan, and Muharram, and fixed Pakistan holidays including Pakistan Day and Independence Day. It adjusts demand multipliers and inventory recommendations accordingly. It also integrates live weather data via OpenWeatherMap for real time context aware forecasting.

The platform is built as a modern two tier web application:

| Tier               | Tech                                          | Role                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**       | React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Recharts     | Interactive SPA dashboard              |
| **Backend**        | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (async) + Celery + Redis | REST API, ML pipeline, background jobs |
| **Database**       | MySQL 8.0                                     | Persistent relational storage          |
| **Cache / Broker** | Redis 7                                       | Caching + Celery message broker        |
| **Deployment**     | Docker Compose                                | Single command full stack startup      |

### Container Topology, `docker-compose.yml`

| Service         | Container                | Port        | Purpose                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `api`           | `retailiq-api`           | 8000 → 8000 | FastAPI backend                 |
| `client`        | `retailiq-client`        | 3000 → 80   | React SPA served by Nginx       |
| `db`            | `retailiq-db`            | 3307 → 3306 | MySQL 8.0                       |
| `redis`         | `retailiq-redis`         | 6379 → 6379 | Cache + Celery broker           |

| `celery-beat`   | `retailiq-celery-beat`   | —           | Scheduled tasks, daily insights |

---

# Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop**, or Docker Engine + Compose v2, for Windows, macOS, or Linux
* **Git**, optional, for cloning
* **Approximately 4 GB free RAM** and **10 GB free disk space** for images and data

No Python or Node installation is needed. Everything runs inside containers.

---

# Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoazzamFarooqui/RetailIQ.git
cd RetailIQ
```

### 2. Configure environment, optional

Copy the example file and add your API keys if you have them:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first build downloads base images and installs dependencies including Python ML packages and Node modules. Allow approximately 10 to 20 minutes. Subsequent starts take seconds.

### 4. Verify

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All six containers should report `healthy` or `Up`.

---

# Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root, using `.env.example` as a reference:

```env
# Application
APP_NAME=RetailIQ API
APP_VERSION=2.0.0
ENVIRONMENT=development
DEBUG=true

# Database
# For Docker Compose, internal network:
DATABASE_URL=mysql+aiomysql://retailiq:retailiq@db:3306/retailiq

# For local development, SQLite:
# DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///data/retailiq_v2.db

# Redis
# For Docker Compose:
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0

# For local development:
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# JWT Authentication
SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-long-random-string-in-production
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7

# API Keys, optional
# Weather data
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Holiday data
HOLIDAY_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Celery
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/1
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/1

# CORS
CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000","http://localhost:5173","http://localhost:8000"]
```

> **Note:** In Docker, `docker-compose.yml` overrides `DATABASE_URL` with `mysql+aiomysql://retailiq:retailiq@db:3306/retailiq`, so the backend always uses the containerized MySQL database. Without API keys, the platform falls back to built in Pakistan Islamic holiday tables covering 2024 to 2028 and seasonal defaults, allowing the system to remain fully functional offline.

### Dataset

RetailIQ ships with the **M5 Walmart retail dataset**, containing 30,490 products across 1,941 days in `data/raw/`. A subsample covering 3 stores and the full 2011 to 2016 range is pre processed into `data/processed/engineered_features.csv`, along with compact analytics aggregates.

You can upload your own retail sales CSV at any time through the Upload page.

# Data Pipeline

RetailIQ processes data through a structured pipeline with five major stages.

### 1. Ingestion & Validation

```text
Upload CSV → validation (date, sales, item_id, store_id) → data quality report
```

### 2. Cleaning & Storage

```text
Auto clean (missing values, types, duplicates) → Save to MySQL → Save to data/processed/
```

### 3. Feature Engineering

```text
Load cleaned data → FeatureEngineer.create_all_features()

  ├── Time features (year, month, day, dayofweek, is_weekend)
  ├── Cyclical encoding (sin/cos of month, day of week, day of year)
  ├── Pakistan seasons (Spring, Summer, Monsoon, Autumn, Winter)
  ├── Holiday features (is_holiday, days_to_holiday, pre Ramadan/Eid windows)
  ├── Weather features (temp, humidity, rain flags, weather × season interactions)
  ├── Lag features (1, 7, 14, 28 days)
  ├── Rolling statistics (7, 14, 28 day means + stds)
  ├── Price features (change, momentum, price vs average)
  └── Event & SNAP features
```

### 4. Model Training & Forecasting

```text
Train 5 models → Compare metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R²) → Select best → Save

Autoregressive forecast → 7, 30, 90 day horizon → Store in MySQL

Async via Celery worker, scheduled daily insights via Celery Beat
```

### 5. Inventory & Insights

```text
Forecast → InventoryOptimizer (safety stock, EOQ, reorder, stockout, overstock)

Data → InsightsEngine → Natural language insights, recommendations, health score
```

### Data Regeneration Scripts

The analytics endpoints read compact aggregate files, `analytics_daily.csv`, `analytics_products.csv`, and `analytics_meta.json`, rather than the full engineered frame, which can reach hundreds of MB. Regenerate them after any raw data change:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the long format engineered frame from data/raw/, 3 stores by default
python backend/scripts/regenerate_engineered_data.py --stores CA_1,TX_2,WI_3

# 2. Rebuild the compact analytics aggregates
python backend/scripts/regenerate_analytics_aggregates.py
```

# Troubleshooting

### API Container Keeps Restarting, `Exited (3)`

Check the logs for the underlying error:

```bash
docker logs retailiq-api --tail 100
```

Historically resolved issues include:

* **`ping() missing 1 required positional argument: 'reconnect'`**, caused by `aiomysql 0.2.0` and `PyMySQL ≥1.1` signature changes compared with SQLAlchemy's pool pre ping. Fixed by pinning `sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.31` and `PyMySQL==1.0.3` in `backend/requirements.txt`.
* **`Field "model_type" has conflict with protected namespace "model_"`**, a Pydantic v2 warning. Silenced using `model_config = {"protected_namespaces": ()}` on the schemas.

### Analytics Page Shows an Error or Empty Charts

The API needs `data/processed/analytics_daily.csv`, `analytics_products.csv`, and `analytics_meta.json`.

Regenerate them:

```bash
python backend/scripts/regenerate_analytics_aggregates.py
```

Then hard refresh the browser using `Ctrl + F5` to load the rebuilt frontend bundle.

### Frontend Changes Do Not Appear

The client is a static build inside the image. After changing `client/src/*`, rebuild the client:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build client
```

### Backend Changes Do Not Appear

`./backend` is bind mounted, so after editing Python files, restart the API:

```bash
docker restart retailiq-api
```

### Port Already in Use

If port 3000, 8000, 3307, or 6379 is already taken, change the host side of the mapping in `docker-compose.yml`, for example:

```text
"3001:80"
```
